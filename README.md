# Barista Bot!

This bot was made to fuel my caffiene addiction while also saving some money vs buying from a coffee shop every day.

## Required Materials

	1 x Raspberry Pi(and means to connect to network)
	4 x Perasiltic Pumps
	4 x 12v Relays
	4 x Syrups of your choice

## What it does?

	Barista Bot works by controlling 4 12v relays to manipulate perasiltic pumps attatched to different flavored sweeteners. 
	
	Barista bot passively exists in a discord channel shared between me and my roomates. When somebody would like a drink they can order it on discord by using the command `!order <flavors`, the bot will parse the string and extract the individual flavors that the user wants.
